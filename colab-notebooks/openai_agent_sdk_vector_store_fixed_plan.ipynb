            "    - **Qualified Improvement Property**: Improvements made to the interior of nonresidential buildings may be classified as QIP. However, QIP does not include improvements attributable to the internal structural framework or expansion of the building.\n",

            "    \n",

            "    - **Use**: The appliance (walk-in freezer) is used in a retail food business (bakery).\n",
            "    - **Placement**: Leased property.\n",
            "    - **Permanence**: Typically treated as personal property if it can be removed without significant damage; otherwise, it may be considered real property if it is intended to remain indefinitely as part of the property infrastructure.\n",
            "    \n",
            "    ### Step 2: Leasehold Improvement or QIP\n",
            "    - If the freezer is affixed to the building and would significantly alter or damage the property upon removal, it could be considered a leasehold improvement.\n",
            "    - If the improvement is on the interior of a commercial building, it may qualify as Qualified Improvement Property (QIP). However, certain improvements, such as enlarging the building, elevators, or escalators, do not qualify for QIP.\n",

            "    ### Step 3: Accelerated Depreciation Options\n",
            "    - **Section 179**: Allows for immediate expense deductions for certain property, but it must be personal property. The freezer might qualify if it’s considered personal property.\n",

            "    ### Step 4: MACRS Class Life\n",
            "    - Under MACRS, if it's personal property, it generally falls under a 5- or 7-year class life. If it's real property, it might have a 39-year class life for non-residential buildings.\n",

            "    ### Step 5: IRS Updates\n",
            "    - **TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act)**: Allows for QIP to be eligible for 100% bonus depreciation.\n",

            "    \n",
